# Genomic Classifier Large Language Model (LLM)

### University of Maryland Global Campus

### Purpose of Project
Create a neural network using Scikit-learn or PyTorch that can classify DNA sequences into functional categories, e.g., noncoding vs coding, protein vs RNA coding, type of protein, type of RNA, etc. Ultimately this should be able to predict the function of novel sequences by identifying patterns in the sequence, even without any direct matches in existing databases.
